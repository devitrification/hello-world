# hello-world
as described in GitHub Guides

As a lazy person, I always believe I would be ashamed of myself about using GitHub, for it keeps all my activities online and public, surely huge vacancies in my activity log book are expected, not to mention the typos, broken English, etc.

However, I am also so encouraged by the nice GitHub users, I learn a lot from the wonderful repositories in GitHub.

So, let us push and pull! Hello World.
